# twotac
Two-factor router and switch authentication with an open platform and a simple set of management scripts.

## Overview
At its most basic, the average network device uses a local login system. All too often, security systems rely on one known username and password. TACACS+ is a major improvement; users can be managed individually from the local UNIX machine, and logging, requests and other information become more descriptive as TACACS+ becomes the primary method of logging in, thereby making it easier to detect security breaches and other suspicious activity. TACACS+ has one more advantage, that it can be redirected to and through other systems, such as Google's two-factor authenticator. Twotac embraces this, combining a number of other ubuntu applications to make for a fully functional AAA authentication server that is easy to set up and run. Twotac comes fully equipped with a web registration interface, a mailer system, its own logging and backup scripts, and a user registration script which automates the process.

## Prerequisites
Twotac is dependent on a number of important applications, and not just TACACS+. To install this software, you will need:
TACACS+
PAM
google-authenticator
apache2
postfix

## Installation
To install Twotac (in its current state) please run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dsturm-l/twotac.git
dpkg-deb -b twotac/
sudo dpkg -i twotac.deb
```
If there are missing dependencies, please run:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -f
```
If twotac was not installed by dpkg due to missing dependencies, rerun the dpkg -i command.

## Twotac Setup
To set up the twotac system according to your own organization and administrators, please run:
```bash
sudo tacmanager
```
Tacmanager is a simple, menu-based system that should help configure, run and read out information on the system.
If you haven't run tacmanager yet, it will try to run a first-time setup. Let it. It will ask for important information, such as your organization name, the e-mail address of your administrator, your registration website's domain name, an SMTP address usable by the host server, and most importantly, your TACACS+ key. It will also try to overwrite your existing configurations for postfix, PAM, and TACACS+. After it's done this, it will combine the new default scripts and your submitted information about your company to rewrite the included scripts and content to your personalization.

## Additional Setup
Just because twotac is designed to run with a website, SMTP relay and TACACS+ does not mean you can run twotac's installation and have a AAA authentication server running immediately. There is still much work to be done on the administrator's end. The hostname will need a DNS reservation. The host server will need a static IP address from DHCP so the network devices on AAA can access the server reliably. There ought to be a functional SMTP server if the administrators plan on using the mail system or the web interfaces. And lastly, this software does not actually configure your network devices. 

Example configuration for Cisco devices:
```bash
aaa new-model
tacacs-server host 000.000.000 key 2tacdefault
aaa group server tacacs+ LoginAuth
server 000.000.000
aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ local
aaa authorization exec default group tacacs+ local
line console 0
login authentication default
line vty 0 15
login authentication default
```
